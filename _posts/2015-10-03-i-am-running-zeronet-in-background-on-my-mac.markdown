Since when I was little, I always loved peer-to-peer technologies... I even tried to create a GNU/Linux distribution based on that. .. but recently I have discovered a brilliant project that is combining the power of **asynchronous cryptography**, using **Bitcoin** private and public keys, with **BitTorrent technology.** This project is called [ZeroNet](http://zeronet.io) and it is a new and interesting way to provide websites¬†and real-time services in a p2p network.

To join the network and browse the ZeroNet websites, now you have¬†to **keep running¬†a python software** in one of your **terminal**.¬†I really hate to keep it opened 24h a day... even if I am nerd enough to love logs. I decided to run an instance of ZeroNet in background on my Mac: every time I turn on my computer, I am updating and seeding content. I feel happy to help this community üëç Here is how I made it possible. <!--more-->

First, I have created a _launchd daemon_. So I¬†cloned the [github project repository](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet)¬†in my home directory (~/ZeroNet).

    $ cd ~ ; git clone https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet.git

Then after that I have created the launchd daemon by editing the file:

    $ nano¬†~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.zeronet.plist

And adding the following content, of course **replacing** /Users/koalalorenzo with **your own home path**:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>io.zeronet</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
         <string>/Users/koalalorenzo/ZeroNet/start.sh</string>
       </array>
       <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
       <dict>
         <key>HOME</key>
         <string>/Users/koalalorenzo/ZeroNet</string>
         <key>STNORESTART</key>
         <string>1</string>
       </dict>
       <key>KeepAlive</key>
       <true/>
     </dict>
    </plist>

I have then added a new script able to update the repository and run the server. So I have edited a second file:

    $ nano¬†~/ZeroNet/start.sh

Adding in it the following simple code:

    #!/bin/bash
    cd /Users/koalalorenzo/ZeroNet/
    git pull
    sleep 5
    /usr/bin/python /Users/koalalorenzo/ZeroNet/zeronet.py

Then I had to change the permissions of the file so the Daemon would¬†run it:

    $ chmod +x ~/ZeroNet/start.sh

The only thing missing was to launch it! So I had to activate the Daemon on launchd by running the following commands:

    $ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.zeronet.plist

Once loaded, because I had every dependencies installed and it was running already before, the daemon works¬†without errors, allowing me to browse to ZeroNet, without having a terminal opened. :)
