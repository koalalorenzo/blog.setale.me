If you think that a keyboard layout can **boost** your **productivity**, you should consider the **time** you will spend to **learn** a new one, the hassle and the **frustration** when typing something wrong... but if you love **programming**, you may consider to **buy/switch** to the **international** keyboard.

Back in February, I had to switch to a new MacBookPro. My old 2011 13 inch MacBookPro, started being impossible to use... and after 4 years I had to remove all the stickers from its back and turn it off forever. I am still _in mourning_ after its _death_.

Considering all the times I've been playing, working, writing and programming with it, I feel sad... but I feel even worst when I think that I did it using the **Italian keyboard**, that was really impossible to use to write code: the keys that I need are **hidden** by **combinations** of _shift_ and _option_. This is really common in several keyboard **layouts**, like the Danish or German ones.

The _Option_ button (or _Alt_ for some keyboards) is the **big problem.** If you look at your **hands** while typing you will notice that probably this "layout switcher" is right **under your palms**. This means that you have to **move your hands** to press some combinations that are including it... and you do this every time.

The international keyboard layout, instead, puts all the **buttons** we need, right there, and we can get `[ ] ' \ / . - ;` and `,` **without** crazy **combinations**. If we need something more complicated you can still use the _shift_ button, and you can activate it **without** **moving** **your** **hands** from the previous position.

There is a **feature** that is helping me when I need to write other "**special vowels**" by holding the one I need. You can read more about it [here, on the Apple support website](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11264?locale=en_US). For example to write København I will hold `O` when i need ti write `Ø` and something like this will appear:

To be honest, it is **not a big deal**, but this is the reason why my MacBookPro has an International Keyboard instead of a localized one. It is easier to use to write code. My hands are thanking me for this choice :-)
