The journey that I have decided to take with [Siderus](https://siderus.io/) 
brought myself always in embarrassing moment on meetings **Hyped discussion** 
about ‚ÄúBlockchain‚Äù and data storage. In this article I don‚Äôt want to talk about 
the misconceptions about storing data into a blockchain, but instead I want to 
focus on a more generic question that I have been asked: Is a blockchain useful 
for human being? Can we use it for good?

From now on I am going to talk about Bitcoin and Ethereum, not ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù nor 
distributed ledgers (DLTs). I do believe and I do use the word Blockchain when I
want to fool people as it works perfectly for PR Stunt. I am not that kind of 
person and I prefer to talk about the technology: The current implementation of 
Ethereum and Bitcoin are considered as a base of this article.

Are those technologies good for humanity? We can tackle this question from 
different point of views, financial, data privacy, automation... but in all the 
cases we know we live in a ever-evolving era and Ethereum and Bitcoin are 
continuously getting improvements, but most of the core concepts will stay 
there.

One of these core concepts is related to data immutability. It is one key factor
to have an ordered list of events that are immutable over time. All these 
transactions contains data that can‚Äôt be changed, and therefore it will raise a 
question. What if I publish something and later on I will regret? In most of the
cases this is related to financial decisions and especially for Ethereum, it may
be related to some IPFS hashes getting published or some Smart Contract events 
or a dApp registration to get some free kitties. This means that if you agree 
on publishing any personal data there, you are sure it will stay there 
forever... 

Have you posted something on facebook that you are now regretting? That doesn‚Äôt 
exclude the fact that in first place the user should be more responsible for the
data before uploading it. Thanks to the European laws I will be able to extract 
all the information and use the right to be forgotten... 

But when using a decentralized service like bitcoin you have a technical limit: 
you can‚Äôt ask the nodes to forget an old transaction containing some of your 
data or the hash of that content. Why? It is technically impossible to do so. 
This is an important feature to validate future data. If somebody says to you 
that they have a ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù where data can be deleted, probably it is a fake 
blockchain. That is why a simple white paper with no technical details about 
how it works may be just a PR stunt. Document yourself before using any 
technology! 

Having said that, when there is an issue the Open Source communities joins 
together to find solutions and build new products. Data can be encrypted 
already and privacy (kinda) is on its way to Ethereum. A lot of dApps do not 
require you to upload your personal information in a blockchain, and I don‚Äôt 
think there is even space for that in a block. At the same time at Siderus are 
working on several solution to increase the space usable in Ethereum/Bitcoin, 
as well as ensuring data encryption. In any case, nobody can stop the users 
from uploading their sensible data on any platform: Remember that embarrassing 
post somebody shared on Facebook long time ago? üòÖ


_So is this technology good?_ I think so, but **don‚Äôt be stupid**.

A good example is the [Refugee project made by Bitnation](https://refugees.bitnation.co/). 
That sounds like a good idea for some people: schedule the refugees, track them 
to offer emergency  services and validate their identities. is it good? This 
could be different, as some may agree, others may disagree. I don‚Äôt like humans 
to be tracked as cattle... but the implementation could be different and it 
could respect every human being by applying some concept of cryptography, or 
just using it to validate integrity of data.

What about a Ethereum-based Facebook? This one is more interesting, because it 
will reduce censorship, help exchanges of ideas... but by removing the control 
over the data that Facebook has, the platform could breach the ethical limits, 
as well as people regretting decision. The case of Cambridge Analytica would be 
a joke, as even if encrypted some information will always be available to the 
whole network... and being able to remove that a from the blockchain would 
defeat the benefits of having a blockchain in first place.

You can use a knife to kill, to hurt yourself or to prepare a delicious meal. 
The same applies for these technologies. It is up to us to choose how. We can 
make mistakes but we also need to learn from them. Are Ethereum and Bitcoin 
good for us? Is this protocol and technology a good choice for humans? I will 
let you decide. My obvious take on this is: yes it is, but use it wisely. 
Seriously.
