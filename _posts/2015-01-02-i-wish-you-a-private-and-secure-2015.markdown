During the 2014 I've learned how much privacy and security are important. Apart from my "_nerdy needs_", I started observing my habits, considering **who** reads **what** and **where** my important information are stored online. My bank accounts, passwords, email and some private conversations should stay private and encrypted. Some other information should still be available to somebody as other documents could be read by anyone.

I discovered and I got **annoyed** by the fact that, in order to provide a "spam-free inbox" or other [advertisement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail#Privacy) service, all my emails are read and scanned by _Gmail_. I also [got rid of _Dropbox_](http://www.businessinsider.com/edward-snowden-warned-of-dropbox-hack-2014-10?IR=T) because after [thousand of passwords leaked](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/10/14/dropbox-passwords-leak-online-alleged-hack/), I felt bad that some of my documents were stored in a **not-really-safe** service. So, when I am communicating or sharing things with others, I decided to switch to secure and private channels when needed... including those services that are considering **encryption** [as a serious thing](http://www.cryptofails.com/post/70546720222/telegrams-cryptanalysis-contest) and not just **a joke as SSL**. So I wrote down a list of suggestions to improve the privacy and the security.<!--more-->

I changed my habits in order to **prevent security or privacy problems**. The web is [full of resources](https://ssd.eff.org/en) and here are some suggestions that I found:


  * Use **GnuPG** to encrypt and sign files and messages. [Read more about GPG on Mac](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/mac-user#how-use-pgp-mac-os-x)
  * Use **BitTorrent Sync** to synchronize files, instead of _Dropbox_... [Just install it](http://www.getsync.com/)!
  * Start surfing the web using a **Virtual Private Network**. Build your own **OpenVPN** server if you can: It is MUCH cheaper and safer than buying any service! [Read more here](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/human-rights-defender#playlist)
  * Use **End-to-End encryption** with Adium/Pidgin or _Telegram_. [Here is the guide](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/mac-user#how-use-otr-mac)
  * Activate the **Firewall** on all your devices... always!
  * Enable **2 Factor Authentication** where possible. [Read more](http://gizmodo.com/how-to-enable-two-factor-authentication-on-all-your-acc-510245714)
  * Generate **random**,** different** and **stronger passwords**. I use [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) and I really suggest to _do not sync over iCloud and Dropbox_, but instead [use BitTorrent Sync](http://digiex.net/guides-reviews/guides-tutorials/application-guides/13815-how-setup-1password-syncing-bittorrent-sync.html) and [local WiFi](https://guides.agilebits.com/1password-ios/5/en/topic/sync-over-wifi) for your **iPhone/Android**.
  * Manage **privacy settings** on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/privacy) and other social networks.
  * Share messages, photos and documents carefully, asking yourself "_who should not see that?_".


I collected those **suggestions** that helped me to keep my documents safe, but I don't want to cause paranoia, because sometimes there is no need to get **obsessed** by encryption and privacy settings. If you have any other suggestion, please write a comment down below to share it with other readers. I wish you a private and secure 2015! :)
