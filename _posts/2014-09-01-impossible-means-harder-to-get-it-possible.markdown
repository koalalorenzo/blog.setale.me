Several times, I have heard my grandparents saying "that is impossible" when they are comparing what the young generations do to what they were used to do. According to the [dictionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/impossible), what is impossible, is "_not possible, unable to be, exist, happen, unable to be done..._", but for what I have noticed and experienced, is just a matter of **points of view**.

Today I saw on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI_7_qTKA3c), comparing the _new_ generation of MacBook Pro with [Macintosh Portable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Portable), and we can see clearly the difference between those two models, but the main difference is the release date. You have all the rights to say me that I am talking about a trivial thing, but it's really good to introduce the thought I have in my mind. <!--more-->

The Macintosh Portable, yes that _big-plastic-"90's gray"-heavy thing_, was released on the **September 20th 1989**. At that time the technologies were totally different than today, and now we can almost say "obsolete". Nevertheless, that piece of cold engineering became really obsolete few years later. On the February 11th of the amazing **1991**, that heavy guy started being "_a piece of history_".

I may think about "future" things, but they will always **appear as "impossible"** to my practical eyes. I may say "people take flying cars in the future", maybe they will, maybe they will not. I really believe that what I see as **impossible** is still possible, but **the effort** to make it real, so to **make it possible**, is **higher**. What is impossible for me could be possible to somebody else or in another time of the history. It's just a matter of points of view.

The main reason behind this choice by Apple was its battery. Technically you can [read more about that on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Portable#Criticism), but the battery problem is important to understand my idea: If we could **travel back in time** and go on Semptember 20th of 1989 with the **concept of the modern MacBook Pro**, or just even with the concept of the modern batteries, how do you think people and engineers will react?

Probably they may say that the MacBook Pro is an _impossible_ concept, even thinking from the technical prospective of that time. It took almost **20 years** to make the right battery and screen for the MacBook Pro... Or even the MacBook Air. Steve Jobs, _as many others determinate people_, took his entire life to create Apple's products, that in the 80s were considered as "_impossible_".

That's also why I think that if you have a concept that may appear impossible, **you can push to make it possible**: steps by steps, goals by goals, everybody can change the world somehow, and make their dreams come true! That's why from my point of view, what it is "**impossible**" is just **harder** to be **possible**.
