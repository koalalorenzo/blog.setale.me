Few days ago, while watching [The Martian](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/) something special happened to me: I got my first **epileptic seizure. **I don’t remember that much of that evening, but I realized how much I grew up by moving away from Italy, and deciding to stop working for Startups.

Almost 2 years ago I decided to **escape my country** to find my path abroad. I accepted a **job offer** to be the **CTO** of a **Danish startup**, lead by Italians.

I moved to [København](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen). I don’t have any regrets, and I still suggest my friends to move abroad as soon as they can, to make more experiences. <!--more-->

More than one year after, the same company gave me two options: **quit** or move to **Netherlands** to work for the _new partners_, but with no benefits, no shares, no quotes nor money for my hard work, even if **I asked** a few months before, to really **be part** of what we were doing .

**I decided to quit** and move on to the **next adventure**. Something different. By joining a **bigger company**, I discovered several things including:

  * Without a degree, but a lot of skills,
I can achieve a **better salary** than the “startup” one.
  * **Happy** and **productive** **working** **environment**
with good_ _bosses really exists.
  * I can get **benefits**, even if working hard for few monts.


I was not thinking about it until few days I go. Until the **seizure**.

I was watching that movie, and I fainted. My boyfriend told me that every muscle of my body was really stiff and my back arched, then I fainted and screamed while shaking. The only thing that I remember of that evening is me on the floor surrounded by people. Then two ambulances arrived to the movie theatre. I was not the only one feeling like that.

We are weak because we are humans.

I made wrong decisions that night. My body was weak because of several things combined. I made the **wrong choices**. That made my body weak. My brain decided to _reboot_, because my body was **weak**. Because I made **wrong decisions**.

This event is helping me realising how much weak I am as human.
I made the wrong decisions as human.

One single hasty decision may lead us to something that was not expected. I decided to quit the startup world _for now_, and I am happy with that. My single **hasty decision** was to **work hard** without thinking about **my** own **future** and **reward**.

By reading my past journal, I discovered that I was excited by the possibility of changing the world with the share economy, that I forgot how important my salary was, or the experience of the people in the team.

I have learned only a few things from this experience. By moving abroad
I discovered how **not** to **judge**, how to **live** with **people** from different **countries**, and that “Classist discriminations” jokes are not appreciated
in Scandinavia. Nothing related to my **expectations**. I was **not growing up**.

It was **not worth it**. I had the most **stressed** period of my life. I have **learned nothing** but how to follow the **wrong lead** that forced me to **cheap solutions** over clients satisfactions. If I will ever take the decision to **work** for a **Startup**, I will think twice… and think about **my own future**.


These months working in that bigger company, gave me the big chance to **think differently**. I am **not thinking big**, I am **not** thinking **outside the box**. I am **happy**. Quitting a Startup that was stressing me, taking every single breath out of me, was just the **best decision I took**.

Life tip: **if you are considering** to join a **Startup**, think twice about the team, the idea and your own future inside the company.
Will it be a worthy experience in one year?

Now I am happy, relaxed and with new **selfish goals**. After months I can say that I am working with **amazing people**, in an **amazing place**, and
I think that this time
I will **learn something** in a serious way. Still abroad.

That epileptic seizure helped me to realise **how weak I am**. I am human and I can **learn from new mistakes**. One thing is sure: I will **never drink alcohol** before watching a **3D movie** with **sensitive scenes**. Note: I am not a person with epilepsy :-)
