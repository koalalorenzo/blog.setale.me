Two months ago, I decided to buy two **Bitcoin ASIC Miners**. The reason is quite simple: I am easy to get bored when I have everything prepared and ready to be used. 😴 Particularly if we are talking about technologies and computers. There is no fun if I can’t **learn from crafting it**, right?

When “[The 21 Bitcoin computer](https://21.co/)” was announced I was surprised to see a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) device with a huge black brick on top of it: an ASIC Chip that mines between 50 and 120Gh/s. Basically it is an “already assembled and configured” device that can mine and be a Bitcoin full node. 👍

That seems to be an awesome product, for thousands of reasons, but I have decided to not buy it. The reason is not the price (~_400$_) or the software inside that is pre-compiled by a new company for you. The reason is simple: it would bore me.

I believe that the **target** of the 21's computer is a **spoiled developer**, that has **no time** to **synchronize** the entire blockchain or **configure** an external mining device: It comes pre-loaded with a **copy of blockchain** (~40GB of space) and with a software that will _easily_ mine with the 21’s pool.

So I decided to build my onw 21 Bitcoin Computer, capable of mining, programmable also using the official RPC-API interface, and with a full Bitcoin Node... and some extra security software! 😜

💪 I started rolling up my sleeves, and I ordered two Antminer U3 on Amazon 🛍 . Then I took my unused Raspberry Pi, an external old HardDrive and, when the miners arrived, I turned everything on with the power of Forums and Documentations.

I compiled and configured all the softwares by myself and the time spent was worth. I spent less money by recycling old things and that made me feel even better. The result was a RaspberryPi connected to some devces, with several cables. Ugly but I am happy with that. 👏

After some weeks of checking and playing with different mining pools, and configuration and integration with the API and NodeJS… I got bored… again…

In any case, the _device_ that I have built is still up and running, serving a copy of the blockchain 📜 (as full node), and getting me a continuous amount of [bits](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Units) every day ⛏, and I can play with these money if I want… but **why**should I if [we have a Testnet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet) for these purposes?

At the end of the day I can say that probably the 21 Bitcoin Computer would be **cheaper in electricity** **consumption **than** **2 Antminers and a RaspberryPi. By quickly browsing 21.co website, I can understand that it would not be **fun** as **building** my **own**, **original**, **handcrafted**, **safe** and **controlled** **Bitcoin Computer** 😻 and by building it, I learned several new things related to the protocol and the API interface… and I am proud.

Consider that: if you don’t want to spend too much **time** and you have 400$, I strongly suggest to [buy it on Amazon](https://21.co/buy/) today: There is a **lot of fun in using it **as well, and learn how the Bitcoin protocol works! 😉
