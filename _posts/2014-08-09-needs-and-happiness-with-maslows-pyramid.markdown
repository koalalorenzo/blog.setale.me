Before moving to Denmark, when I was in Italy, I was focusing all my attention on the main actions to get material things and physical welfare: I was happy only when I was able to achieve my goals. The truth is that I was able to achieve my goals, but as soon as I got stuff done, after a short period of happiness, I had the same feeling when the tv series I am watching is over, and there are no more episodes to watch: looking for something to re-fill that feeling of nothingness.

So I reminded that [Tommaso Grotto](http://www.tommasogrotto.com), once told me about his own version of the [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) and I decided to think about that, _redrawing_ and thinking from scratch **what happiness means to me**. I am not a psychologist and just for fun, I created my own Maslow's pyramid, based on the **needs I can satisfy to be happy** and on my **life goals**. <!--more-->

I created a new pyramid made by needs connected to specific life-goals and actions: At the bottom of it there are needs that I can **satisfy easily**, (like _eating junk food_) and on the top the needs that require a **bigger effort** (like _found another company_). I don't want to share it here, _because is really personal and I am sorry_, but I hope you get the idea: I really suggest everybody to create their own Maslow's pyramid.

To really use my "_pyramid_" I started **comparing** it with my every-day **whims**: by asking myself  "_where should I put this whim inside the pyramid?_" I understand what priority and if that whim makes me really happy. If it _fits_ or is connected to some of the _pyramid levels_, I will perform the **actions to satisfy** the need behind that _whim_. This helped me to distinguish things that really matter and things that doesn't, like for example, my decision of [not buying a new phone](http://koalalorenzo2014.wordpress.com/2014/01/31/no-all-acquisto-del-nexus-5/) at the beginning of this year: there was something more important to do than spend some money for **something that I don't really need**.

Even If I live in the [happiest country in the world](https://sundhedsstyrelsen.dk/en/medicines/consumption-analyses/consumption-of-antidepressants-in-denmark-in-the-primary-health-sector-in-the-period-1994-2003), I think that this is **really personal** and probably there is not a single way to see the Maslow's pyramid. I am not a psychologist but I think everybody should build a pyramid... and listen to the [happy song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM) :P It helped me to clear my mind from stupid whims.
