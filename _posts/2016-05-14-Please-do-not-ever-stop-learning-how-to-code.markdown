I remember when I was 10 and my mother was worried about me staying too much in
front of the computer, writing lines of weird text on a black and white screen;
I used to be one of these boys that were not supported by friends and family,
because it was hard to understand _computers_‚Ä¶ ü§î but now things have changed,
and writing code is _cool_.

I consider myself a 75% **self-taught developer**, meaning that I have been
learning how to write code by myself, a little in school and by working. I have
been working with several developers that taught me a lot. Some good developers
suggested me new and exciting things. Others **bad developers taught me how to
be a better developer**. I have recognized a pattern in almost all of them: they
are not continously learning new things, and they don't care much.

I have read [this article](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/?utm_source=blog.setale.me)
recently, and I cannot stop to agree with it. I wanted to write this post long
time ago, but it may sound _offensive to somebody_, or a good motivation to
start doing something new.

The main problem I have recognized is that most of self-taught developers are
people that are not continuously learning how to code, and they are not
implementing new technologies or improving the way they are writing code.

I think that they took initially a ticket for the exciting train of coding just to jump into
something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, or to boost their career. Yes, anybody can **achieve**
some new goals by reading a **book** or following some **tutorials**, but at the
end of the day you have to learn really a lot in order to see what you are doing
wrong.

I have been learning a lot about how things works, and how my code can be
improved. I am currently **mastering** NodeJS and performing JavaScript.
_Now_ I know a lot of things that are **happening behind the curtains**,
not just ‚Äúthe logic code‚Äù. _Now_ I do understand why it is important to **learn**
all that **bull-shit** that they taught me in the **university**‚Ä¶
_Now_ I see the difference between me and somebody that do not start to count
from 0. üòÖ

It is not just about optimisation: it is more about the style of the code,
the development flows, the way we write commits, tests, the documentation
and‚Ä¶ all those small things that at the end of the day are **making everything
better**, faster and with a better quality. üëç

I can‚Äôt say to a Designer, a Project Manager or a Business man to not learn how
to code. They should do that, but they have to be aware that they will not write
things properly at the beginning, and probably they should **leave their jobs to
real Developers**. Mastering something needs time‚Ä¶ a lot of time!

Please, learn how to code, but **do not ever stop** doing that! Improve yourself
continuously or you will cost more money than actually hiring a senior
developer.
