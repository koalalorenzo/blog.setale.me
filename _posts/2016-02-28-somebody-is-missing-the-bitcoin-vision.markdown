I have my own  clear vision of what it would be the **future of value exchange**. At the moment I am running a [Bitcoin Classic](https://bitcoinclassic.com), **full node**. This is because I want to keep a **copy of the blockchain** to verify my payments and make the **Bitcoin network stronger**. I have also a [p2pool](http://warp2pool.eu/) mining node and 2 miners, to be able to express myself with the bitcoin “consensus” (without thinking of profit).

Sadly, somebody had the bad idea to start an [attack against some Bitcoin Classic nodes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin_Classic/comments/47zglz/ddos_started_again_have_a_nice_day_guys/), in the war against Bitcoin Core. Somebody is missing the **bitcoin vision**: For few hours, my internet connection was not stable or down, and I have to believe that this event is connected to this **stupid DDoS attack**.

**I don’t care who did it**. I care more why they did it: **What is the point** of blocking me and making a DoS attack to me and my Classic Node? <!--more-->

Bitcoin Classic is a _modified_ version fo the Bitcoin Core client, that wants to **increase the block limit to 2MB**: this will speed up the transactions verification, allowing more people to use the technology and reducing waiting time and fees. This update will be **applied if the 75%** of the 1000 last blocks, will be **mined using Bitcoin Classic**. Then the nodes have 28 days of _grace period_ to update to Bitcoin Classic and accept 2MB blocks.





  * Running a node means that you want this change.
  * Mining on that node means that you are helping to reach the 75%.



By running a DDoS attack to these nodes, if those people want to **discourage to run Bitcoin Classic**, they have the opposite reaction: They indirectly told me to spend more money to **mine classic blocks** to help to reach the consensus over 2MB as block limit.

But **to the eyes** of somebody that does **not know what Bitcoin is**, this is only **bad advertisement**, since we should have a community that is supporting the use of BTC as a value of exchange, **solving cultural and technical problems** and removing that “_bad smell_” that some people **think** it has. We should not fight against each other, _corrupting people_ and making every aspect of it like it was **coming out from** a cracker/**hacker movie** in the late 90s. _I am not wearing leather jackets and controlling the traffic lights!_

I am scared that if nothing is changing, this will **lead us** to the same situation in the **GNU/Linux world**: it will be use only by **nerds** and **developers**, because people were **too much focused** and busy on **solving technical problems** and fight against **forks of distribution**, **licenses**, that people forgot to make the software **usable** and **spread** the real open source **message** around the world. [Mark Shuttleworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth) helped to stop it, but the direction was clear: the **capital was used** to develop GNU/Linux for servers and not for desktop. A _server oriented_ [B2B model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business) was creating more services and more money, with **less efforts** than a desktop solution.

This DDoS attack is really stupid: we should **stop using Bitcoin as a “nerd-only” value of exchange**, and start investing the **capitals in ads**, **companies** and **diversified development** to spread Bitcoin to everybody and make it better. How do you think people will see another DDoS attack to some nodes? It’s time to start thinking in a global vision. Somebody is missing the Bitcoin vision, and I believe it will change: **Bitcoin Classic** will make **this** **vision real** again.
